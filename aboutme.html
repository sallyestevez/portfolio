            <p>Hi, I'm Sally Estevez. I'm a user experience designer and web developer based in Brooklyn, New York.
              I study Integrated Design and Media (IDM) at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering and will be
              graduating in May 2023. I decided to pursue IDM because I was drawn to the creative aspects of technology.
            </p>
            <p>I have been programming since my junior year of high school. An alumni of Code Nation, I have gotten
              first place at their annual hackathon twice - once in 2018 and once in 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy learning new skills. I'm always eager to use what I learned in current projects! I hope to create 
              applications that help make people's lives easier by ustilizing my expertise in design and web development.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my free time I enjoy reading, listening to music, going on walks, knitting, and playing video games.
            </p>
