            <p>Hey, I'm Sally Estevez! I'm a product designer and front-end developer based in New York City.
              I graduated from NYU Tandon's Integrated Design & Media (IDM) program in May 2023.
              I decided to pursue IDM because I was drawn to the creative aspects of technology. 
              I love that I'm able to blend my passion for problem-solving with artistic expression, 
              enabling me to develop solutions that are both functional and aesthetically impactful.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy learning new skills, and I'm always eager to use what I learned in current projects! I hope to create 
              applications that help make people's lives easier by ustilizing my expertise in design and development.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my free time I enjoy reading, listening to music, going on walks, knitting, and playing video games.
            </p>
