            <p>This is a website that is meant to inform people about the sources of Jeff Bezos' wealth.
              It also talks about the poor treatment of Amazon workers. Links to all sources are provided.
              This project was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also uses the Carousel JavaScript library.

          <p>This is a "travel website" for the fictional planet Mira from the video game Xenoblade Chronicles X. 
            There is a separate page for each region (for a total of 5) and a home page.
            The website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also uses the Fancybox JavaScript library.

          <p>The page returns sun and moon data based on the day. Users can switch between viewing sun and moon data.
            The page also returns a song based on the hour. The project was made using HTML, CSS, and React.js. The 
            sun and moon data were drawn from an <a href="https://ipgeolocation.io/documentation/astronomy-api.html" target=""_blank>
            astronomy API</a>. The song data was drawn from a JSON file created by me.

          <p>Discord does not allow users to send files larger than 8 MB. I proposed a Discord update that would include
            an in-app compression feature for larger files. I conducted user interviews to determine what Discord users 
            were interested in. I also researched competitors to see how their features differ from Discord's. I creaated 
            wireframes and used them to build a prototype in Figma.
