          <p>I led a comprehensive overhaul of the Ktown4u website to enhance the user experience, visual appeal, and functionality. 
            By conducting user research and usability testing, I identified key pain points and gathered insights to inform the redesign. 
            I developed wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity mockups using Figma, focusing on improving navigation and information architecture.</p>

          <p>I created a "Choose Your Own Adventure" game inspired by real retail workers' experiences during Black Friday.
            The player takes the role of a Walmart employee navigating different retail scenarios and making choices that 
            impact the storyline. The game was made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also added background music to enhance 
            the gaming experience.

      <p>For this project, my group and I focused on enhancing the accessibility of a field researcher training page for older audiences. 
        We gathered insights to improve usability by conducting user interviews with individuals aged 55 and older. 
        We optimized navigation, typography, and contrast ratios to create a user-friendly interface that complies with WCAG guidelines. 
        We created wireframes and used them to build a prototype in Figma.
